# midi-cube

A MIDI-Workstation written in C++. Inendend to both work on Single-Chip-Devices with a touch display (Raspberry Pi) and Computers.

## Planned features:
* Serveral integrated virtual instruments like a B3 organ, an E-Piano-synthesizer, a sampler, drumkits, a subtractive/additive/FM-synthesizer, etc.
* MIDI-Routing between devices
* Looper, Arpeggiator, Sequencer/Drum Machine
* A touch responsive GUI
* A web interface or a desktop client that allows uploading new sounds
