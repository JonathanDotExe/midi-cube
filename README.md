# midi-cube

A Synthesizer-Workstation written in C++, intended to both work on Single-Chip-Devices with a touch display (Raspberry Pi) and computers.

## Planned features:
* Serveral integrated virtual instruments like a B3 organ, an E-Piano-synthesizer, a sampler, drumkits, a subtractive/additive/FM-synthesizer, etc.
* MIDI-Routing between devices
* Looper, Arpeggiator, Sequencer/Drum Machine
* A touch responsive GUI
* A web interface or a desktop client that allows uploading new sounds

## Installation
On Windows the building process is quite complicated, which is why I supply Windows binaries with every released version.
On Linux the build process is pretty straighforward. MidiCube supports two build systems: Meson and CMake. The Meson build file compiles everything into one executable and compiles faster. CMake is slower but separates the project into different modules (Note: only the compilation process takes longer, MidiCube will have the same performance with both). At the moment it doesn't matter which build system you use but in future I will add a plugin API and different "hosts" (like the workstation ui you know now, a stripped down ui for use as an fx device on a raspi or a DAW plugin) where it might be from advantage to use the modular CMake build. Furthermore, CMake allows you to install MidiCube with all the relevant files using make install.
### How to install with meson on Ubuntu/Debian
1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure to install the dependencies
		
		sudo apt install meson ninja-build libsndfile-dev libsfml-dev librtaudio-dev librtmidi-dev libboost-all-dev
		
3. Build it using meson (working directory is the clone project)
		
		mkdir build
		meson ./ build
		cd build
		meson configure --buildtype release
		ninja
		
5. Run the compiled "midi-cube" file in the root folder of the project

### How to install with CMake on Ubuntu/Debian
1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure to install the dependencies
		sudo apt install cmake build-essential libsndfile-dev libsfml-dev librtaudio-dev librtmidi-dev libboost-all-dev
3. Build it using meson (working directory is the clone project)

		mkdir build
		cd build
		CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release cmake ..
		make DESTDIR=/your/install/location install

5. Run the compiled "midi-cube-workstation" file in the installation folder
